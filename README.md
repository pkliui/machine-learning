# Independent coursework on machine learning

This documents records examples of my independent coursework on machine learning. 

# MIT 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning - Prof. Leslie Kaelbling




# [DeepLearning.ai Tensorflow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)

## [Course 2 CNN in Tensorflow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)

### Week 1 - Simple CNN for binary image classification (cats vs dogs)

* [Cats vs dogs example 1](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week1/Course_2_Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification_Simple_Model_Overfitting_Example.md) - image classification using small data set, an example that leads to overfitting
* [Cats vs dogs example 2](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week1/Course_2_Exercise_1_Cats_vs_Dogs_Full_Dataset.md) - an example using full data set

### Week 2 - Data augmentation for binary image classification (cats vs dogs)
* [Cats vs dogs example 3](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week2/Course_2_Lesson_2_Cats_vs_Dogs_With_and_Without_Augmentation.md) - an example of image classificaion using CNN w/ and w/o augmentation

### Week 3 - Transfer learning for binary image classification (cats vs dogs)
* [Cats vs dogs example 4](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week3/Course_2_Example_Applying_Transfer_Learning_to_Cats_v_Dogs.md) - shows an improvement in classif. accuracy using transfer learning

### Week 4 - Multi-class classification using data augmentation 
* [Sign language MNIST example](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week4/Course_2_Exercise_4_Multi_class_classifier_using_Augmentation.md)
