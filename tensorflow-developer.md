## Course 1 - Introduction to Tensorflow

### Exploring neural networks
* Introduction to NNs, tweaking number of neurons,  layers and epochs, impact of  image normalization, overfitting and callbacks for early stopping
* [A computer vision example](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course1-intro-to-tensorflow/Copy_of_Course_1_A_computer_vision_example.md)

### Convolutional neural networks
* Convoluions, max-pooling
* Tweaking number of filters and number of layers
* [Fashion MNIST example](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course1-intro-to-tensorflow/Copy_of_Course_1_Convolutional_nets.md)


## Course 2 - CNN in Tensorflow

### Simple CNN for binary image classification (cats vs dogs)

* [Cats vs dogs example 1](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week1/Course_2_Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification_Simple_Model_Overfitting_Example.md) - image classification using small data set, an example that leads to overfitting
* [Cats vs dogs example 2](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week1/Course_2_Exercise_1_Cats_vs_Dogs_Full_Dataset.md) - an example using full data set

### Data augmentation for binary image classification (cats vs dogs)
* [Cats vs dogs example 3](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week2/Course_2_Lesson_2_Cats_vs_Dogs_With_and_Without_Augmentation.md) - an example of image classificaion using CNN w/ and w/o augmentation

### Transfer learning for binary image classification (cats vs dogs)
* [Cats vs dogs example 4](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week3/Course_2_Example_Applying_Transfer_Learning_to_Cats_v_Dogs.md) - shows an improvement in classif. accuracy using transfer learning

### Multi-class classification using data augmentation 
* [Sign language MNIST example](https://github.com/pkliui/machine-learning/blob/master/tensorflow-developer-specialization/course2-cnns-in-tensorflow/week4/Course_2_Exercise_4_Multi_class_classifier_using_Augmentation.md)
